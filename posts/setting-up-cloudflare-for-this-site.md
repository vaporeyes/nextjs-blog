## A Subdomain for My Notes

I've been using Obsidian for a while now and it has this interesting paid feature for publishing notes. I decided to setup Cloudflare as my DNS for this site and use it to host my Obsidian notes as a subdomain, i.e. `notes.josh.contact`, it was literally as easy as clicking some buttons, changing nameservers and waiting for DNS to propagate. And now I have a notes subdomain! I figure longer-post things would end up here and shorter musings, thoughts and other things ending up there.

## Now I Have to Write More

I would like to write more (online anyway) as it feels like it helps me consolidate thoughts and feelings on topics. I've kept a written "diary" of sorts, more like an engineering journal, off and on for many years - since my early days in IT back in 2008/2009. I found that once I moved into information work (from driving forklifts) that I needed to remember far more "things"; since the brain is so tricky and fickle, writing things down has been key.

## The AI Boom

This new agentic coding / AI boom is very interesting. It _feels_ like, if we do this right, agentic coding could really make experienced programmers far more productive in addition to bring junior and mid-level engineers up in their understanding. To me, thats the real issue: using AI safely to avoid knowledge rot. I do feel there is something to be said for "understanding" what is happening underneath.

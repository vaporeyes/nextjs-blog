One of my favorite things to make is lemonade. This is a method I use:

## Ingredients

- 1-1/2c sugar
- 1/2c boiling water
- 1-1/4c to 1-1/2c lemon juice
- 6c cold water

## Instructions

1. Squeeze the lemon juice through a sieve to catch any seeds into a separate container.
2. Boil enough water to pour 1/2c of it into an Anchor or Pyrex measuring cup.
3. Pour that measured water into the final container.
4. Pour the sugar into the final container and mix well.
5. Pour the lemon juice into the final container and mix well.
6. Pour in the cold water and mix well.
7. Let sit in the refrigerator and chill for a while.
8. Enjoy!
